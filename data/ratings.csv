We have both wish I had of seen this first. The cost of the sponges makes this more economical.After having two since Dec 2019 . I would not recommend this product. One developed a leak.

Sylvain Mercier,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on August 16, 2021",        Disappointed  ,"We have tried using this for 4 months. We tried basil, oregano, thyme, chives, lettuce, and spinach. The lettuce did well at the start, but after a few weeks it just died. Nothing else germinated. Round two we got thyme, oregano, and spinach, but the spinach is now dying after a few weeks (didn’t get big enough to harvest) and the other two are starting to look sad as well. Very disappointed in this, as we were very excited to try it.",1,,,,,,
Scott F.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on March 11, 2021","        Fire Hazard, LED light started to burn AVOID!  ","Zero isn't a rating selection, so I'm settling on 1 star. Had this unit for only 3 months , but I'm passed my refund date by 1 month so I'm stuck with this thing. Today, there was a bad smell coming from the light unit, like a circuit burning, so I touched the light area where the input power plug goes in and it was extremely hot to the touch, and the pump was no longer working either  so I disconnected it immediately, to avoid a bigger problem! Glad I caught it in time before it got worse. I've sunk a lot of money into getting the pods, seeds, food, PH tester, only to have it die in the end. Nice knowing you growing system, you'll fit perfectly in the garbage bin.  ",1,,,,,,
MM,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on August 9, 2021",        Plants do not grow  ,"          We set this up and have been running it for over two months now.  Most of the plants sprout but die as they just come out. One Basil is barely coming out and won't grow over two inches. We tried tomatoes and peppers too but they grow a couple of inches and don't flower.For the amount of time, energy and money on this product, it's better just to put a potted plant on your window sill or outside.

I have soaked the dirt things in hydrogen peroxide and water to kill them all but then a few days later there are more bugs. Even with the caps on and everything covered, I somehow keep finding flies underneath in the water. It is because they are laying eggs in the dirt part since they stay wet all the time.  ",1,,,,,,

Toni L,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2021",        It Just Stopped Working and The Nightmare Began  ,"I bought this before the Christmas holiday. We didn't open the box and set it up until mid January.  It was great.  We bought some seed packs from Aero Garden and some individual seeds to use with the pods that came with the system.  We set it up and we started getting growth in about 7 to 10 days.A little more than one month later in February, it stopped working.  It just died.  We didn't move it.  It just would not turn on.  That's when the customer nightmare began.  Finding out who to contact took some work but I did.  I sent an email on Feb. 27th to them at info@moistenlandrip.com and fuszrj@outlook.com.  I got a response that same day from fuszrj@outlook.com.  Great!  The person asked what happened and for the order number.  I provided that information.  Three days later, I get an email from a different email address (info@moistenlandrip.com) asking for the same information that I had provided.  I sent it again.Four days later, I received a response from fuszrj@outlook.com asking for my shipping address.  I provided that on March 9th, and then did not hear a word for almost 3 weeks. That's when I decided to contact Amazon on March 26th and get them involved. They shipped out a replacement unit and it arrived yesterday.  I sent an email to the company on the same day.  They noted that they would check with Amazon.  Really?!  You didn't think to get back to ME after almost 3 weeks and send me a replacement like you promised?! The customer service is beyond horrible.  Other reviewers noted that but I ignored it.  Go with the Aero Garden if you can.  If this thing breaks again for no reason, I will.",1,,,,,,

However bo really happy thus far.  Set up was ok, not to complicated. Like the aerogardon pods better these are very spongey and the hole is tiny so when you have a bigger seed found they ripped easily. Out of 12 seed I've planted over a week ago 1 has sprouted.

D,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on February 26, 2021","        Impressed with the unit, not the seed pods.  ","I am finding with this hydroponic growing system the seeds do not root well, as the plugs have an extremely shallow divot. Finding my seeds die within a short period with just a sprout of green and a thin small root barely poked out of the seed (IMO seems the issue is it's not able to get to the water for nourishment in order to thrive)....unlike the Aero garden that has the deep divot tubes which the seed is capable to germinate within a close range to the water level to thrive and develop a strong root system. The unit itself is well made, and has features (like the fan) that the aerogarden does not have. The reason I gave it 3 stars is the shallow seed pods.",1,,,,,,
C Kelm,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on July 14, 2020","        Easy to set up, hard to maintain. Worth it if you put in the effort.  ","I want to start this by saying I really do like this product. Its perfect for growing small to medium sized herbs, its compact, looks nice, and makes growing plants hydroponically relatively easy, making it inviting for new people to try it. I've had this product for a few months and I've been able to fill multiple spice jars of herbs I've harvested. However, there are some issues and constraints with this product. Be prepared to constantly prune as many plants can grow well past the maximum height. The light is also not on a timer, I tested this twice and it simply stays on indefinitely. This is the biggest problem as it means you have to turn it on everyday and therefore theoretically can't leave it on its own for more than a day. I tried to solve this using a WiFi connected smart outlet to set a timer, but it can only control the power to the machine, not just the light specifically. This is also a problem as the water pump MUST run continuously and can't be turned off for hours at a time. The water pump/fan are set to a 30 minute timer on/off and work correctly. Lastly, this is only really realistic for starting seedlings and then transferring them elsewhere. Once things begin to really grow (after 3-4 weeks) the container size is unsuitable for 12 adult plants. I've been able to harvest herbs, but I have yet to see any finish its life cycle. First, because the plants absorb water faster than the dissolved fertilizer, it increases the concentration of fertilizer drastically and somewhat rapidly. Plants have an ideal concentration range for fertilizer and going too high is similar to trying to grow crops in salty soil. The result is you realistically have to add water everyday to avoid high fertilizer concentrations.To summarize, okay product but it has a few flaws, mostly the lack of light timer reduces the usefulness of this product. As a result its pretty high maintenance with the pruning, water requirements, and height constraint.",1,,,,,,
Camila Jerger,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on November 24, 2020",        Not for newbies in hydroponics  ,"          This hydroponics kit has a lower price point compared to competitors, which is the main reason why I bought it. It looks nice although it's a little big bigger than I expected. I was disappointed that the instructions that came with it were confusing and not easy to follow for someone who is new to hydroponics. Lots of steps on how to germinate and take care of the plants are missing from the instructions, and I had to search for information elsewhere. I'd wish they've sent better instructions since I've been having trouble to get my plants going on this hydroponics system and not sure what I am doing wrong.So nice kit, buy it if you have experience growing hydroponics, but if you are a newbie like me, I'd suggest look for another kit.

Dedip,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on February 24, 2021",        Bon produit mais avec des bémols  ,"J'ai acheté un jardin de 12 plantes et tout a été livré rapidement. Le produit est très bien emballé. Il comprend, outre les paniers et les éponges de mousses de sphaigne, il vient avec une pince pour les semences, un perce-éponge, un bouchon d'évacuation de réserve et une mesure pour les nutriments. Il y a aussi des marqueurs pour identifier les plantes qui sont trop gros et tiennent mal dans les trous. Il manquait 1 panier. J'avais acheté aussi quelques plants Aerogarden, qui sont compatibles et qui comprennent une petite bouteille de nutriments, donc ça me convenait.Le ventilateur et la pompe ne sont pas bruyants. Le premier soir, j'ai déconnecté l'appareil, pour le repartir à 4 heures du matin, afin de lui permettre de faire son cycle de 18 heures et voir s'il s'éteignait bien. Après seulement 3 jours, le basilic et la coriandre pointaient hors du sol. Le plan de tomates cerises a atteint 6 pouces (15 cm) en 3 semaines. Merveilleux! Les graines que j'ai planté moi-même ont aussi bien poussées, mais il faut s'assurer d'avoir de bonnes semences. Les épinards n'ont pas levés, j'aurais peut-être dû faire tremper les graines 1 heure avant de les planter. Il faut vraiment ne conserver qu'un seul plan par panier, sinon les plantes étouffent.Après 5 jours, la minuterie de l'éclairage ne fonctionnait plus. J'ai contacté la compagnie qui m'a donné un excellent service et qui m'a renvoyé un nouveau jardin par livraison rapide. J'ai dû cependant leur fournir mon adresse et mon numéro de téléphone hors connexion Amazon, afin qu'il puisse ouvrir un bon de commande chez Amazon. Le problème du premier jardin s'est réglé de lui-même. Mais cette fois, c'est le 2e jardin qui a eu le même problème de minuterie et il était plus bruyant. Je l'ai retourné.À mon avis, le cycle de 18 heures est trop long. Si vous dormez plus de 6 heures par nuit, vous ne pouvez pas voir si l'éclairage d'éteint et s'allume normalement. Il faudra donc vous coucher tard et vous réveiller occasionnellement la nuit pour vous assurer que tout fonctionne correctement. Il est également dommage qu'il ne contienne pas les nutriments de départ.J'en ai acheté un de remplacement de marque IDOO à 7 plantes. Eux ajoutent les nutriments pour 4 semaines mais pas la pince et le perce-éponge (ce qui n'est pas essentiel). Il n'y a pas de ventilateur, dont très silencieux. Il contient différents cycles d'éclairage, soit 14/10, 12/12 et 16/8. Là, je vais pouvoir faire des nuits normales. Cette compagnie indique également que les semences ne sont pas incluses en raison des restrictions sur les importations.En bref, ces petits jardins sont merveilleux, mais comme ce sont des compagnies chinoises, la qualité est très variable. Assurez-vous d'en choisir un qui a un cycle de fonctionnement qui ne deviendra pas un incovénient, comme le Moitenland l'est devenu pour moi.",1,,,,,,

We liked the first so much that we bought this one as well: one for herbs and one for lettuces. The first one keeps the lights on for 18 hrs/day, which suits the plants well, and it came with the right pods and baskets.

Bought the nutrients, seeds, ph down, and ph meter separately. My feedback would be to include these items (except the seeds because I would rather choose those myself) with the product for easier set up and use. I had some issues with green algae growth after adding nutrients and have had to purchase hydrogen peroxide as well. Now that I’ve figured out a good system, things are going better, but I think having a more clear, easy to understand, step by step manual and package with all the required add ons would make this system much easier to use.

This unit is cheaper than AeroGarden and works just fine ... the trick we have found to make it really ""sing"" is to insert some aeration stones in the small tank. These stones are creating so much oxygen in the water tank that our strawberries and blueberries are starting to flourish and the romaine lettuce (AeroGarden pods) are growing very nicely. For AeroGarden pods, we wrapped the part of the pod that did not fit all the way into the unit with masking tape to prevent additional fungal growth in the tank due to light getting through to the nutrient rich water. Our AeroGarden is working as intended without stones or any other helpers ... we are using that as a base test but think we are going to be buying a few more of these units.  ",1,,,,,,

You have to buy your own seeds and plant food, and that is fine with me.Jan. 9, 2021 Update: I got my second unit before the New Year and it came with a growing tray and hole covers. I've planted cherry tomatoes and more lettuce - great salads! From my original unit I still harvest lettuce once a week, I've done so a total of 5 times already, by taking only 1/3 of the plants each time. I am very happy with my purchase! And the replacement grow sponges are now in amazon Canada.I now have 3 units (this is addictive...) and rotate the lettuce so I always have a fresh supply. Note: do not plant lettuce and tomatoes (or any fruiting plant) together as they have different nutrient needs.*** June 2021 update: the fan in the unit makes a terrible noise and has to be turned off. I emailed the seller several times and got no response. The unit is less than 6 months old, this is unacceptable, so I am downgrading my rating to 3 stars.

ChrisN,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2021","Overpriced, tiny growing system","This unit is surprisingly tiny. Came with only the containers (pods), no fertilizer, no seed, no extra pod. The pod is about thumb-sized and fairly short. Being a new gardener I'm quite confused as to how this work (or I wouldn't buy this unit would I?) but I assumed the seed need water to sprout, so I had to fill the water all the way up in order to keep the pod hydrated- definitely spilling alert with little kids at home. The seed hole on the pod is really tiny. One cilantro seed is enough to fill it up. Poor instruction. It's apparently written in another language and directly translated into English and with very little information. I had to spend quite some time to figure out how to install the water pump- and why do I need a water pump?? This unit is very tiny but stylish looking. If the plants do grow it would be a cute tiny little green corner in the house. For what this came with I think it's overpriced.",2,,,,,,
Leslie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on October 29, 2021",Not easy to use for a beginner,"This garden is cheaply made and the instructions are not clear at all. If you are buying your first ever hydroponic garden, this is not the one for you.

LT,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on April 11, 2021","Not the complete starter set I was hoping for, but a decent little grower setup","Comes nicely packaged and somewhat straightforward to assemble together. Being completely new to these indoor gardening sets, I did need to go through the instructions to put everything together. Would say that once assembled it looks fairly discrete and the gooseneck light can be adjusted to be lower for new plants which minimizes the amount of light it throws out to the surroundings. Water pump is near silent and seems powerful enough to move the water around from what I could see. 8, 12 and 24h timers are a nice touch though I have no idea if this is granular enough or not.In terms of cons, the missing liquid fertilizer and seeds is a big bummer especially for a newbie like me. Considering I have no idea what to buy, I'm actually already looking for pods from another brand of indoor garden to try. Some other things I assume are going to be problems would be, the included growing pods are fairly shallow which I think would mean that you are forced to ensure the water reservoir is nearly completely topped up constantly. I noticed that other seed kits appear to have longer growing baskets which would ensure the plant gets access to water for longer (this is just an assumption)Overall, I'm pretty impressed by what you get for the price compared to some other units but as I now have to do a bunch more research to see what I need to get started with.  That being said, it seems to be a pretty good growing setup and I would think once I get started it should do nicely but won't be able to tell until much later. Will update if any of the parts prematurely give up the ghost. Otherwise if you're just looking for a fairly inexpensive hydroponic grower, this is a pretty great item. If you want a starter kit, you may want to look at other sets that also include seeds and liquid fertilizer.",2,,,,,,

Kdb,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2021",Needs better instructions,"This is only my first impression review and I’ll add more as things start to grow (if they do). My main concern is the instruction pamphlet that comes with this — it’s missing a lot of necessary info. There aren’t complete instructions for how to assemble it, including how the pump goes in. It’s almost like it just says, “Put it together” and leaves it at that. I think I got it together right, but there aren’t even photos of the inside to compare it to. Then the planting instructions are also a bit lacking, when it tells you to add nutrients, but not how much or what. There is no fill line for the water — they just tell you to add “enough” — how much is enough?You can adjust the light to work better with different plants and you can change the times, but they don’t say which is better for which type of plants. There are also things that don’t make sense, like the stickers they give you to put on top of the lids to label the seeds. They stickers are round so it looks like they go there, but they block the light if you put them on top. I put them on the sides because I didn’t want them permanently on the unit next to each.I’ll update my review as I continue using this, but I will say that so far I’m not impressed. They really need to understand that unless someone has used something like this, they need clear and complete instructions.",2,,,,,,

When I saw this, I was excited to give it a try. The directions are a bit weak. I *think* I set up everything fine. I followed the directions to the best of my ability. It comes with the pods, but no seeds. I picked up some seeds from the store and soaked them as instructed. I planted basil, oregano, chives, and cilantro. It's been about 2 weeks now and I have basil and oregano sprouting. It's actually a little more than sprouting because I can see tiny leaves. The water is not very easy to see so it's difficult to know when you need to add water. I ordered some plant food for hydroponic gardens because none was included.

The pump itself is quite strong, and I think it will handle circulation well. Overall, I think this product had good intentions but was just thought out very poorly.

Thinginabook,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on September 27, 2021",Good as a starting point,"So far I've been enjoying this kit - it was easy to set up and my herbs started growing within the first week. The instructions are easy to follow, but why at this time and age Amazon still allows products with terrible english translations? The manual itself is easy to follow, but gets confusing just because the translation doesn't make any sense. Anyway, this kit only comes with the tank, light, water pump and the seed containers and sponges, plus covers for the holes (which prevents algae growth) and plastic caps for the plants while they're growing (they aren't self-adhesive, so having some transparent tape helps). You need to provide the seeds and the plant food. Thankfully the manual, with its bad translation and all, provides some guidelines regarding planting and feeding.Regarding the construction, all the pieces are plastic, they are easy to clean and setup. The timer works well, although it's very simplistic: to set up, turn on the light at certain time and it should turn off after a certain amount of hours has passed (for example, mine starts at 7.15am and turns off at 11.15pm, as mine is set to 16hrs). The pump runs for 30mins and goes off for other 30... and it does everything quite silently. The tank itself doesn't have a Max Fill line, the manual mentions this, but the box mentions that the max capacity is 1.6liters.So far so good. I'm only growing herbs, which sprouted super fast! also, the light is quite powerful, so other plants I've in regular pots have been taking profit of it. I think it's a bit tiny for, let's say, lettuce or tomatoes, but probably I'll give it a shot with other things in the future.",2,,,,,,
The Westleys,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on April 27, 2021","Good for novice, but not beginner","I wouldn't recommend this little kit for total beginner's who want a stress-free experience. Since you must source the seeds and food and do the research for yourself, it's not as beginner friendly as an Aerogarden. However, it is a fraction of the cost, so if you're a beginner willing to do that, it could absolutely work for you.The reservoir is much bigger than the cheapest Aerogarden (the Sprout) and you have one more 'hole' here as well. For novices, those who've already grown hydroponically in a smallish size (or bigger) and are looking for another easy to start container, this is perfect. If you already have the seeds and food and know what can and can't be grown hydroponically in this size, you'll do just fine.Setup is relatively simple and while the instructions don't guide you on all the hydroponic growing info, they give you enough clear details to setup the garden. I wish the holes were a couple of millimeters deeper in the grow sponges as having the seeds so close to the surface makes me a little nervous and one of my sprouts did 'fall out'.I like the gooseneck design and it's easy to adjust. Depending on what you grown it may not be possible to use every hole. So far I'm growing Spinach and Kale and they are just seedlings, so I'll update on this once they are a little bigger.Overall, it's a simple garden kit, which lacks the guidance of bigger, more expensive brands, but it's perfect for a novice who just wants a fast, budget option to start in!",2,,,,,,
The Westleys,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on May 12, 2021",Has the Essential Elements of a Hydroponics System But Misses a Few Convenient Features,"This Moistenland Hydroponics System comes mostly pre-assembled so getting it set up is quick and easy. The round shape is attractive and accommodated my multi-tiered plant stand nicely. Most Aerogarden's would have been too wide for it.This system gets most of the basic features right, including a powerful LED light, a timer for the light, and a large water tank so roots can have ample room to grow. The light is full-spectrum and bright and powerful, even more so than on most Aerogardens. It's on a short gooseneck, so while the precise height cannot be controlled, it's good enough and has ample coverage to make seeds grow rapidly.Yet there are a few drawbacks with this unit that are worthwhile to consider. For starters, unlike the Aerogarden, there are no reminders of when to fill up the water and, more importantly, when to add the liquid fertilizer. Water is easy to remember to add as this is done fairly frequently or when you hear some splashing. But fertilizer at a twice-per-week schedule can easily be forgotten, or it can be added too frequently.Another drawback is the port where the water is added. It is just a very narrow hole, so it's easy to spill some water when adding it. Also, I wish it could support more than just four pods. But overall, these drawbacks aren't a deal breaker. The system is effective in areas that count the most and supports good growth. I know have a thriving herb garden.",2,,,,,,
Luke,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on May 16, 2021",Good value but you need to provide your own seeds and fertilizer,"This is a very hands-off approach to growing your own herbs and veggies and it requires very little knowledge to harvest a lot greenery over the course of one pod’s growing life. I plants Basil, thyme and rosemary as those are the herbs that I use the most on a day-to-day and weekly basis. I don’t always like to use dried herbs as a substitute and I hate paying several dollars for a few sprigs of rosemary or thyme, it’s ridiculous!This allows me to grow more Basil than I need in a week and the rosemary and thyme goes quickly since I use those a lot. The harvested herbs or plants can be dried and frozen or made into a compound butter/oil. I like that this Moistenland hydroponic grow unit is not too large so it fits in my kitchen without taking up a significant amount of space. The light isn’t bothersome and you can always turn it off temporarily.It’s more cost effective when compared to an Aerogarden system so I’d definitely recommend this version if you’re interested in growing your own plants. The downside is that it doesn’t come with fertilizer or seeds to get you started right away.PROS+ 4 pod unit is more manageable for beginners+ 1.6L water tank doesn’t require topping up often in the early stages+ Grow and harvest your own fresh herbs and veggies+ LED’s flexible gooseneck reaches 12.6” high & can be adjusted lower when starting seedlings+ Quiet and unobtrusive.+ Low maintenance and care required.

Nothing like freshly grown herbs that you grew yourself. The unit arrived neatly packaged and I read the instruction manual to make sure all the pieces were there and that I hooked it up properly.  It was quite easy. You have to provide your own seeds, which is fine because how would the company know what I wanted to grow? There are so many possibilities. I chose basil and oregano. The seeds need to be soaked as do the 4 pods. After you fill the container with water, place the seeds into the pods, using the tweezers that are supplied, put the pods into the base, cover the pods with the plastic covers, plug it in and you’re ready to go. No worrying about putting it near a window - No light? No problem! The 20-Watt LED Grow Light with 40 LEDs (9 red, 4 blue and 27 full spectrum) has an adjustable gooseneck so that you can get close to the pods at the beginning and then move it higher as they start to grow. Then you o ush the ‘seedlings’ button and you’re ready to start growing. Within a few days you can see something developing and a couple more after that, I had a green basil leaf pop up. The pump is super quiet and you hardly notice it. I haven’t had the water level go too low yet, but apparently there is an alarm that beeps to alert you. When that happens, there is a water fill hole next to the pods and you can refill from there without taking the lid off. Overall, I am super impressed with this unit and how easy it is to use. I am looking forward to growing all kids of plants in this unit. I guess I can grow just about anything and when they get to big, I can transplant in a pot or garden.

Ashton Mattingly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2021",Easy to assemble.,"This is a version of an  aerogarden- type hydroponic grower. It is extremely easy to assemble.

The water circulating pump is already installed in the bottom basin. The light has the blue and red LEDs that help stimulate chlorophyll photosynthesis and the height is adjustable by means of a bendable gooseneck. It comes with some pods but it seems be able more or less  to use the newer longer aero grow pods so you shouldn't have trouble finding pods to start seeds or grow cherry tomatoes lettuce and herbs. Otherwise you need the peat plugs and seeds. No plant food came with, I assume you can use liquid miracle- gro.I was able to insert Aeropod (longer pods) and they fit pretty well. My herbs sprouted quickly, so there seems to be no problem to use commercial pre-seeded pods.The competing brand arrow grow has been redesigned by Miracle-Gro and is a lot simpler and less expensive than the previous models and it is also improved. This is a copy but a  different design control panel, not an LED on the front with buttons but the light and the controller all one unit which actually I think is a very clever design.

For a long time, it was almost impossible to find replacements and now they are available they don't fit. On top of that, the ones I bought through Prime were about $30 and it seems they sold out in no time, because now they cost $60 from a 3rd party.I have decided to keep these for now and see how they work, because there are no viable alternatives. I will update this review depending on how they perform. In the meantime, if Idoo wants to keep selling its products, I suggest they get on top of their aftermarket peripherals.

Fridel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Germany on January 2, 2021",Verarbeitung überzeugt mich nicht,"Es handelt sich eigentlich um ein cooles hydroponisches System mit Umluft und Wasserpumpe - zwei große Pluspunkte für den Anbau & Ertrag. Außerdem setzt dieser Hersteller nicht darauf, teure Samen zu verkaufen, sondern macht es ganz einfach, sein eigenes Saatgut zu verwenden: Im Set sind bereits einige Anzuchtschwämmchen & Pflanzenfutter dabei, sodass man wirklich nur Samen bräuchte und loslegen könnte. Dennoch habe ich das System unbenutzt zurück geschickt. Für mich waren vor allem diese negativen Punkte ausschlaggebend:- Das Wasserbecken und die Pumpe sollen laut Anleitung alle 1-2 Wochen gereinigt werden. Das scheint mir aber sehr umständlich zu sein, weil sich das LED-Panel nur schwierig wieder ab machen lässt, aber natürlich trocken bleiben muss. Ich habe es gar nicht erst versucht, stelle mir die Reinigung aber sehr umständlich vor. Schade, dass man das LED-Panel nicht einfacher abnehmen kann.- Der Lüfter ist lauter als erwartet. Die Wasserpumpe hört man kaum, der Lüfter kann aber nicht mit ultraleisen Lüftern mithalten, wie man sie aus dem PC-Bereich kennt. Schade, dass hier gespart wurde. Für das Wohnzimmer ist mir das leider zu laut. Das ist natürlich subjektiv, aber mich würde es auf Dauer nerven.- Der Wassertank wird nur durch einen kleinen Gummistopfen verschlossen, der in das Auslass-Loch gedrückt wird. Mir kommt das sehr labil vor, denn immerhin hält dieser mini Gummistopfen 4 Liter Wasser zurück. Vielleicht bin ich da auch übervorsichtig, aber da hätte ich mir eine stabilere Lösung (z.B.

EJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on August 19, 2021","        Easy to set up, clear Instructions, Pics with update  ","I just recently received my 12 pod iDOO hyrdroponics package.  It’s first go at trying this type of indoor growing.  The box it came in was well insulated that nothing was damaged during the transport. I found putting it together was pretty simple and instructions were easy to follow.  I’ve read some other reviews where dome folks found it noisy, but I didn’t think so.  It’s no different from the humming of my fridge and since it’s sitting in my kitchen counter, they can make music together in concert.  It doesn’t bother me at all.  It sounded quiet to me considering there’s a small motor inside so water isn’t stagnant.  To test it out, i used the back row for dwarf plants (ie: okra, cherry tomato, mini bell pepper, thai chili peppers), middle row for leafy greens that might potentially fit the limited width (ie: Tatsoi, Toy Choi, Choy Sum, 4 season Indoor lettuce), and the front row for select herbs I might wish to have fresh over the fall/winter season (ie: Parsley, Rosemary, Tarragon, Sweet Basil).  This is so I can test different kinds and find out what works best.  Planted them all on Aug 14, and I’m already seeing roots or sprouts on majority of them.  Posted a pic & video. So far I know it works, and any seeds that don’t sprout might be due to the seed itself. The seeds I used are my own.  I did select specific ones that will not grow too tall.  I considered how high the lights can be extended when I made my choices as i wanted to fill all 12 pods.  So far so good.  I will provide another update as my test progresses.  At this time, I’m happy with this purchase.Aug 31 - so far performing as per advertised. Grow lights, fan and pump working as intended and turning on and off as per the “vegetable” cycle with no added action on my part.  All my seeds have sprouted, although I did replace one that was in mid-sprout with another seed due to plant preference.

Taillebuis Amélie,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2021",        Doesn’t work. Get the pump version instead.  ,"I have used 3 hydroponics systems. Idoo 7-pod, idoo 20-pod, a generic LED hydroponics growing system 4-pod. I am severely disappointed with idoo 20 pods as it doesn’t work that well.- Idoo 20-pod comes with 4 small containers with 5 holes for 5 pods each. There’s no pump. The water stays stagnant. It supposed to be efficient on paper since you don’t need to use all the containers at once. However, you do have to change water and fertilizer every week since it lacks in potassium for staying stagnant. Which is very wasteful.- There’s only one light mode but you can change the hours it stays on up to 24 hours. Both Idoo 7-pod pump version and the generic 4-pod LED hydroponics growing systems have 3 light modes with preset hours.- Idoo 20-pod burns sprouts. I’ve used the same amount of light hours on all three systems. The other two had sprouts thriving and turning into healthy seedlings and Idoo 20-pod burned and one sprout died within few hours.- Out of the 10 pods of seeds I have planted only 4 germinated with Idoo 20-pods system. Out of the 7 pods 5 germinated with Idoo 7-pods system (with pump). All pods germinated with the generic 4 pods LED hydroponics growing system. All followed the same instructions provided and received exact hours of light.- For a controlled test I used Idoo 20-pod against the generic 4-pod LED hydroponics growing system using the same amount of light hours and seeds from the same jars. I planted cilantro and basil on both. The generic version germinated basil and cilantro within 4 days, while idoo took 7 days to germinate basil. Cilantro never germinated on Idoo (see pictures for both systems). I couldn’t use idoo 7 pods system since we started using few weeks in advance.- Paid approximately $64+tax on idoo 7 pods and around $129 (incl tax) on idoo 20 pods system. Idoo 20 pods system is totally useless. You’re better off making a DIY version instead.",4,,,,,,

I suspect oxygen is important but I will give this system a try first .Edit: After 2-3 months, I changed rating to 1 star.

Allie Kratz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on November 15, 2021","        Arrived well enough, but was missing multiple pieces  ","Shipping and receiving of this hydroponic was fine, but upon unboxing and sorting of pieces I discovered that the included automatic timer and 4 out of 20 of the advertised pods were not included.I tried to find a way to reach out to the seller and see about obtaining the missing items, but it was impossible. Even trying to reach out to Amazon over this was more of a dead end than anything. Instead, I am making this review of the product.For the 16 pods that I did receive, they’ve been put to good use with a number of different greens. The reservoirs are nice and solid, and while the light stand may be a tad flimsy, it certainly does the job with no risk of being knocked over. It also takes well to the addition of air stones, though standard plugs would be needed to minimize any possible algae.Overall I am fairly happy with the reservoirs, the tray and the lights, though it was a bit of a bummer having to shell out cash for a timer that ideally would have been included with the primary purchase.This has been marked as 3/5 stars due to the primary missing items. Buyer beware.Edit: Added are pictures of two week and three week progress. Root pic included.",4,,,,,,
Allie Kratz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on October 19, 2021",        Good unit but the timer is garbage  ,The system works well but you would be better off with your own timer. The one that comes with it looses 30min at least per day. The manualItself mentions it’s not good for keeping time. Beyond the timer issue everything else works well and is well made.,4,,,,,,

peter andkathy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on April 13, 2022",        Great for starting plants  ,"My review is comparing this model to the 12 Pod system, which I feel is a better system. This system lacks any fan or pump to help circulate the nutrient water. In comparison to the 12 pod model with fan and pump this system does seem to grow in the same manner, and larger plants like tomatoes or beans simply fall over, there isn't really any holding power of the pod setup. I have come to the realization that these systems are starter plant systems, unless maybe light weight herbs, if the plant doesn't have copious root structure, they simply fall over. There are a few plants like lettuce that grow massive root balls and this gives them stability but not all plants have this structure. My advise use this to start your plants and transplant, however I recommend the 12 pod version over this 20 if this is your intention.",4,,,,,,

Angel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on April 28, 2021",        A nice hydroponic Kratky system with good lights  ,"I have a number of different hydroponic growing systems, including the big name brand hydroponic gardens, hydroponic boxes, DWC buckets, and Kratky jars.  When I saw this system, I was curious to try it out, since the big name brand systems come with higher costs and I am always looking for alternatives.Pros:-I like how the system looks.  The containers are cute and it's nice that it is black, so it will have fewer problems with algae.-The lights go up to about 2', so that is good for taller plants.-Comes with a timer that you can adjust the amount of time to be on and off.-Everything is packaged in cute sealed pouches, so it's like opening a present for Christmas or your birthday!-Comes with everything you need to get started right out of the box.-Totally giftable.-The system fits my longer pod cages and sponges from my name brand garden hydroponics system.  (A must for me).-My plants sprouted within days (I have attached pictures of my plants at 2 weeks, 3 weeks and 4 weeks), so the growth is impressive and shows that the lights are strong enough for growing what you like.-I experimented with both my longer pod cages, sponges and nutrients, as well as with the iDOO cages, sponges and nutrients.  My plant roots look great when I used my longer pods and sponges. 4 of the 5 plants in the longer pods sprouted, while 3 of the 5 plants in the iDOO pods sprouted.  (It could possibly be due to the seeds though, since the ones that did not sprout were Echinacea, Cilantro and Spinach, which are sometimes a bit challenging to germinate.)-It works great with an air pump and air stone added.-When using the iDOO pods cages, sponges and nutrients, the ruby red leaf lettuce and basil seem to grow great, so I think other herbs and lettuces would do well with these pods.  For plants with bigger or longer roots, I think maybe using longer pod cages and a different type of sponge would be better.-Hopefully iDOO has replacement LED panels, because it seems easy enough to be able to replace the lights if they go out in the future.-Comes with tags to label your plants.Cons:-The price is still a bit steep, considering there are no pumps, although the system does seem to be adequate for Kratky if you follow the directions and change the water and nutrients each week, so pumps are not necessary.-A pump system would still be nice.-I didn't have the time nor energy to change the water and add nutrients each week, so my plants in the iDOO pods may have suffered.  I changed the water and nutrients every 2 weeks instead.  My other non iDOO nutrients were fine for that.  I'm not sure if the iDOO nutrients were as well.  Possibly.-The iDOO sponges may be a bit too hard for the roots to grow through, since they seemed to be not as bushy or long using the iDOO sponges.  However, they still seem to work for my lettuce and basil plants.  My lemon grass is still very small, so I don't know if that is due to the sponge.  I do hope that iDOO tries to use better sponges in the future.-It's not very easy to see the water level.  Maybe they need to make the plastic window more clear?-It would be nice if a couple little holes in the deck with plugs were added so that we have the option to add a pump with airline tubing and air stone, as well as be able to add some sort of automatic watering system.-Spacer caps for empty spaces would be nice, since I have heard the other iDOO hydroponic systems come with them.-The telescoping mechanism for the lights seems a bit flimsy.  If iDOO used a thicker, rectangular rod with either a button system or a lever system to adjust it, like some other grow light stands out there, it would be better.-It would be nice if the lights could go up higher.  Maybe up to 4' above the top of the containers, so we could grow taller plants?-I think the lights need to be wider (the same width as the containers), since they don't seem to reach all the way to the front or back.-Although 2L containers are not bad, with potentially 5 plants, it would be nice if the containers were taller so more water could be added to the containers and maybe we would only need to change the water and nutrients every 2 weeks instead?Overall, I do like this system and recommend it.  It is attractive, works and I have good growth, especially when I used my own pod cages, sponges and nutrients.  However, using the iDOO pod cages, sponges and nutrients are good too, if you plan on growing lettuce and herbs.",4,,,,,,
Angel,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on September 21, 2021",2021- Unboxing. 1st impress: iDOO 20 vs 12 pod,"progress 2022 The media could not be loaded.                                                                                   Sept 20, 2021 - I just received the iDOO-20 pod system today and I’m offering some pics of unboxing and initial thoughts of the unit, and a some comparison to another model of same brand.  As was stated in the website, this unit does not have pumps so it is a huge difference from the other iDOO models. My review is by no means reflective of the seller or distributor, but about the iDOO unit itself, including feedback for future consideration as a whole.  I am not a professional gardener, so my insights are from my perspective as a user, and limited experience with the brand.  I purchased this because I only have the 12-pod version (iDOO), and find limitations on the grow light height (considering I also planted some okra, peppers and tomatoes, together with herbs, leafy greens).  The bigger unit attracted me to the pod capacity (extra 8 is useful), and the extendable grow light.  I am hoping to transfer my taller plants later, that have outgrown the 12 pod unit, without changing mediums. I’d like to keep my plants indoors for the upcoming Fall/Winter season, working with limited space in my home.Pros:- Quick delivery by Amazon (3rd party door to door) without damage- the parts were very well cushioned and insulated, especially the LED light (even as the delivery guy tipped it over on the side and the box ended up partially open (as he was busy talking on his cell and not paying attention). The timer had a very small dent in the face which was so minor and pure cosmetics, probably from factory where it was made. Not a deal breaker). It works fine.- 4 separate tanks with 5 pod capacity, providing the ability to have varying levels of nutrients (depending plant type and level of growth, since they don’t all mature at the same time).- Option to group types of plants together (herbs, tomatoes, leafy greens, peppers, etc… although there’s a chance of cross pollinating creating hybrids, but should be ok if hand pollinated indoors Or basing the seed positioning on each tank gauging the space required at maturity.- Extendable poles accommodating plants growth (albeit should be handled with care due to aluminum and plastic components). Shorter plants might be more suited to leave in the 12 pod though, as they will be further from the grow light as it is raised to accommodate other growing plants.- the Unit looks really sharp and very presentable. Very much giftable.- larger pod capacity (20), with alternating pod placement (5 in each tray) compared to pods on same rows on the 12-pod (more room for leaves).- The Unit comes with ALMOST everything you need to get started apart from seeds & water, which you have to supply yourself, (Ex. sponges, baskets, domes, trays, grow light, nutrients, instruction manual).CONS:- Suggested Inclusions - It would have been nice if the unit came with spacers or hole covers like what was included in the 12-pod model (6 were included).  As we are talking about taller plants, then we are also considering  bigger/wider leaves. Covers for empty holes would have been needed if this was someone’s only iDOO unit. I have 6 from another model, but I could have used more for what I intend to plant. It would have been useful to have extra. I did see on one review where someone was using what looked like golf balls on those empty holes (very inventive!) but putting a type of band aid solution kind of kills the esthetics of “the look”. But ofcourse, it could work as a conversation starter….- Where to get Refills - I wouldn’t have known unless I didn’t get an answer to my inquiry to an Amazon supplier that this model and the 12-pod, have the same sized basket and sponge.  It should be mentioned in the description for either the Unit or Refill.  I have seen this question asked over and over again in reviews, but nobody has updated the sites.  When you search the Amazon site for iDOO refills, it references IG numbers, it should also be mentioned that the refill for IG301 (12 pod) also works for the 20-pod version, to avoid customer confusion.- iDOO Refills (includes baskets???) - WWHHHYYY do iDOO refill kits have baskets (not even an option NOT to purchase???). They are made of plastic (not biodegradable), and can be washed and re-used for the next sponge.  It’s not like people are so lazy they can’t remove the sponge from the plastic. The sponge cannot be reused without the roots being torn, but the plastic???  I consider this wasteful and of no value to a customer looking for refills. If there was a necessity, it would be the sponge and nutrients A & B.  Instead of these plastic baskets included in the refill kit, why not include plant spacers or basket covers (like the other brands) to prevent algae?  I understand the dome as they are a bit flimsy and can be cracked or misplaced. Help save “Mother Earth” by reducing plastic waste!!!iDOO Accessories (need to be made available with options for consumers) - Amazon/sellers / distributors/ iDOO warehouses (not sure who I should address) should consider selling other items separately and NOT in kits.  Unavailable items such as:  iDOO spacers, plant basket covers, bigger bottle of A &B Nutrients should be sold separately.  There are loyal customers who will stick to the brand, provided that they are reasonably priced, and it exists for purchase, and made conveniently available in the Amazon site.  People should be able to order as needed.  We don’t all grow the same things, and we are all not so rough that we break the baskets constantly for replacement.  The inclusion of baskets on refill kits are a huge turn off.  How many baskets are we ever going to need for both 20 & 12 pod units (I own both)?  Lets do the math.  12 baskets (incl. in 12 pod) + 12 (from refill kit) + 20 (incl. in 20-pod unit) = 44 pod baskets vs combined iDOO model of 22 plant capacity.  Hypothetically, another iDOO refill kit for next year … I’ll own 56 iDOO baskets vs the same 22 holes. The 1st refill I ordered are still sealed in plastic.  For $30+ dollars per order of refill kit, I should have the option to buy what I actually need and not be stuck with wasteful items.  It encourages moving away from the brand or accepting knock offs as we look for better alternatives.  Just food for thought for all vendors/ suppliers/ distributors/  manufacturer, whoever markets these items.NEUTRAL - I cannot add this under the “CONS” for fairness, as the 20-pod has been honestly identified as not having pumps.  Although, just a constructive feedback, it would have been nice if there was a similar or upgraded model of the same size, for those willing to pay the extra price to have small pumps in each tank. I would have bought that instead, if it was an option available.The difference in price point of 20-pod vs 12-pod isn’t very big.  It’s a matter of choosing what fits a person the best for what they are planning to grow indoors. (Ex: Herbs vs Leafy Greens vs Tomatoes & Peppers,  or a mix?",4,,," Plant height, days to maturity, Veggie, flowers or fruits","etc..).All in All, from initial review and comparison of 2 iDOO models, I consider this 20-pod unit a good purchase for it’s capacity considering the price I paid.  Future updates on my review once I actually start using it.Oct 23, 2021 - I’ve so far used 1 5-pod tray. Transferred some sprouted peppers (3) due to the 12 pod iDOO grow light couldn’t extend height any further.  I kept all the peppers in the same grouping.  It looks like the peppers had no problem adjusting. Just as an extra test, I added a Shishito pepper on new sponge just to test how fast it might sprout.  With the varying maturity of each pepper, it does seem like they take up the nutrient mixed water faster judging by the level of the liquid, and the may be taking “nutes” away from the new seed. Also could be my fault for not paying attention to the water level.  In any case the mini bell have produced it’s first fruit, and Thai pepper have started to flower.  There’s no stress to the plants at all using this “kratky” type hydroponics so far.  No complaints so far.Feb 28, 2022 - updated picture of the unit s of today. I did add a small pump going into each of the 4 tanks just because I feel it will mix up the “nutes” better when topping up the water.  I have varying peppers and have been successful in pollinating indoors so far.  I did notice some flowers fell off which i found was normal, considering it’s out of season.  I haven’t been pruning them like I should, but it’s starting to get taller than the highest extension of the grow light. Oh well :)",,
EJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on March 7, 2022",        Good for kratky method.  ,"I mainly use this to grow lettuces but you could use it for other plants. If you are very hands on like me and have time to interact and tend to your plants, this system is great. The main reason is there is no air pump with these so you will have to watch your water levels and change the water every week OR what I do is wait until the levels are close to empty and then top it up halfway. I find if I grow lettuce and greens I only change the water once before harvesting, very early in the seed stage. The benefit of having pumps as with other systems is that you can keep your levels pretty high and take a more hands off approach. Some other cons I find are...1. Only one setting for lights. If you are growing greens, you don't really need the blue light. I also find the blue light in tandem with the other lights gives of an unnatural light for the room so if it is in your office you might find it a bit weird.2. The light is a bit narrow so seedlings on the outside tend to move toward the middle but as they grow they stabilize to the sides.Overall it is not a bad system but there are similar ones with pumps at about the same price. Any new ones I purchase all have pumps but this is a great unit to try out the kratky method and it does work well!",4,,,,,,
EJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on July 7, 2021",        There's no timer for the lights.  ,          There is supposed to be a programmable timer on the cord between the plug and the grow light but there is not one so you have to plug and unplug it in each day.

Client d'Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on January 5, 2022",        Newbie hydroponic grower is happy  ,"My hydroponic journey began at the end of November with another smaller system that was available at a big box retailer.  It wouldn't have the height or capacity to grow much more than herbs and I wanted something that would allow me to grow more and bigger greens, as well as larger plants, like tomatoes.I considered more of a DIY system but upon looking for grow lights, anything decent was approaching the cost of this complete system, so I gave it a try and was glad I did.  At 6 weeks in, I have tons of greens and the tomato plant that I started about a month ago is thriving.I particularly liked the flexibility of this system with 4 separate water containers.  This makes them not only easier to manage, but if I choose to use some of my own larger containers, I could while just utilizing the grow light in this system.My only complaint is that they say to change the water every week.  That's a bit of a pain.  As my other system says the water only needs to be changed every 4 months, I'm wondering what the difference is.The lettuce and herbs taste so fresh and are flavourful.

Hopeless Consumer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on February 1, 2022",        Almost impossible to get replacement pods.  ,"The replacement pods come packaged in ziploc bags, with no branding. They are way too long for the Idoo and have to be trimmed to size and even then they are obviously thicker and bulge out.If they are genuine Idoo pods, then Idoo has a quality control proxlem. For a long time, it was almost impossible to find replacements and now they are available they don't fit. On top of that, the ones I bought through Prime were about $30 and it seems they sold out in no time, because now they cost $60 from a 3rd party.I have decided to keep these for now and see how they work, because there are no viable alternatives. I will update this review depending on how they perform. In the meantime, if Idoo wants to keep selling its products, I suggest they get on top of their aftermarket peripherals. If people can't get replacement grow pods easily, what is the point of owning one? This is how a company loses reputation and business.The machine itself works well, but if there are no pods for it then it's not worth your money.",5,,,,,,

Fridel,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Germany on January 2, 2021",      Verarbeitung überzeugt mich nicht    ,"Es handelt sich eigentlich um ein cooles hydroponisches System mit Umluft und Wasserpumpe - zwei große Pluspunkte für den Anbau & Ertrag. Außerdem setzt dieser Hersteller nicht darauf, teure Samen zu verkaufen, sondern macht es ganz einfach, sein eigenes Saatgut zu verwenden: Im Set sind bereits einige Anzuchtschwämmchen & Pflanzenfutter dabei, sodass man wirklich nur Samen bräuchte und loslegen könnte. Dennoch habe ich das System unbenutzt zurück geschickt. Für mich waren vor allem diese negativen Punkte ausschlaggebend:- Das Wasserbecken und die Pumpe sollen laut Anleitung alle 1-2 Wochen gereinigt werden. Das scheint mir aber sehr umständlich zu sein, weil sich das LED-Panel nur schwierig wieder ab machen lässt, aber natürlich trocken bleiben muss. Ich habe es gar nicht erst versucht, stelle mir die Reinigung aber sehr umständlich vor. Schade, dass man das LED-Panel nicht einfacher abnehmen kann.- Der Lüfter ist lauter als erwartet. Die Wasserpumpe hört man kaum, der Lüfter kann aber nicht mit ultraleisen Lüftern mithalten, wie man sie aus dem PC-Bereich kennt. Schade, dass hier gespart wurde. Für das Wohnzimmer ist mir das leider zu laut. Das ist natürlich subjektiv, aber mich würde es auf Dauer nerven.- Der Wassertank wird nur durch einen kleinen Gummistopfen verschlossen, der in das Auslass-Loch gedrückt wird. Mir kommt das sehr labil vor, denn immerhin hält dieser mini Gummistopfen 4 Liter Wasser zurück. Vielleicht bin ich da auch übervorsichtig, aber da hätte ich mir eine stabilere Lösung (z.B. Verschluss mit Gewinde) gewünscht.",5,,,,,,

I have a few Aerogardens and people say growing cilantro is not so easy. This IDOO I’ve been cutting cilantro now every few days for months and it just keeps growing. It’s awesome for cilantro. I had to level the unit ( my table problem not the unit ). 9 of 12 pods sprouted. Cable management is non existent but I used a plastic cable tube to deal with the cables. Going to try watercress next my guess is that should be good too due to how this IDOO operates. Purchase worth it so far just with the cilantro I’ve grown !,5,,,,,,

EJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in Canada on August 19, 2021","        Easy to set up, clear Instructions, Pics with update  "," Aug 14 - I just recently received my 12 pod iDOO hyrdroponics package.  It’s first go at trying this type of indoor growing.  The box it came in was well insulated that nothing was damaged during the transport. I found putting it together was pretty simple and instructions were easy to follow.  I’ve read some other reviews where dome folks found it noisy, but I didn’t think so.  It’s no different from the humming of my fridge and since it’s sitting in my kitchen counter, they can make music together in concert.  It doesn’t bother me at all.  It sounded quiet to me considering there’s a small motor inside so water isn’t stagnant.  To test it out, i used the back row for dwarf plants (ie: okra, cherry tomato, mini bell pepper, thai chili peppers), middle row for leafy greens that might potentially fit the limited width (ie: Tatsoi, Toy Choi, Choy Sum, 4 season Indoor lettuce), and the front row for select herbs I might wish to have fresh over the fall/winter season (ie: Parsley, Rosemary, Tarragon, Sweet Basil).  This is so I can test different kinds and find out what works best.  Planted them all on Aug 14, and I’m already seeing roots or sprouts on majority of them.  Posted a pic & video. So far I know it works, and any seeds that don’t sprout might be due to the seed itself. The seeds I used are my own.  I did select specific ones that will not grow too tall.  I considered how high the lights can be extended when I made my choices as i wanted to fill all 12 pods.  So far so good.  I will provide another update as my test progresses.  At this time, I’m happy with this purchase.Aug 31 - so far performing as per advertised. Grow lights, fan and pump working as intended and turning on and off as per the “vegetable” cycle with no added action on my part.  All my seeds have sprouted, although I did replace one that was in mid-sprout with another seed due to plant preference. Some of the leafy greens are growing pretty fast compared to my pepper and tomat",5,,,,,,

It's lighter than I expected (it's just plastic) but it's good quality. Assembly was so easy that I thought I was doing something wrong lol. The light and pump timer work well- that was the biggest thing I was unsure about.

You do get a little bit of that reddish growth on the peat pods but there are numerous videos using tinfoil or anything to block the light to help with that, I'm not concerned doesn't affect anything. The root structure is so impressive have to show the lettuce roots  after 2 weeks. This would be great for all ages, it's super fun growing your own food,  and healthier no doubt.
